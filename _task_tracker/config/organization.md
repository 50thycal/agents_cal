# Task Organization Rules

## Categories

All tasks must be categorized into one of these three categories:

### 1. Projects
- Tasks related to direct project work or team lead responsibilities
- Examples:
  - "Send out FiberPoint list to the client for the Thistle project"
  - "Review design documents for Jasper County"
  - "Client meeting for Heinz project"

### 2. Project Management  
- Tasks for budgets, schedules, overruns, tracking, etc.
- Examples:
  - "Update schedule for Jasper County"
  - "Review budget overruns for Q4"
  - "Update Heinz project budget"

### 3. General
- Miscellaneous catch-all for everything that does not fit in projects or project management
- Examples:
  - "Schedule 1:1 with Isaiah"
  - "Clean up internal standards folder"
  - "Order office supplies"

## Work Day Planning

Tasks should be assigned to specific days of the week:

- **Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday** - Specific planned work days
- **Filler** - Flexible tasks to fill in when time allows

## Task Status Options

- **Active** - Current tasks that need to be completed
- **Complete** - Finished tasks (move to completed.json)
- **Recurring** - Tasks that repeat regularly

## Categorization Guidelines

When categorizing tasks, consider:
1. Does it involve direct client work or project deliverables? → **Projects**
2. Does it involve planning, budgeting, scheduling, or tracking? → **Project Management**  
3. Everything else → **General**

When unsure, default to **General** category.
